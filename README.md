# PillowFight3D-Policy

This privacy policy governs your use of the software application (“Pillow Fight 3D”) for mobile devices that was created by BaMe. The Application is a free-to-play game.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personal data. All data preferences (like scores and etc) is stored only in your device and can be erased by uninstalling the app.

This app contains ads by Unity Ads (interstitial and rewarded ads) Unity Ads has probably collected device information, like IP address and device identifiers, and information regarding the delivery of ads and your interaction with them, all of which may be shared with ad publishers and attribution companies.

You have the option to opt-out to stop any automate collected data from ads unity and in-game purchases.
